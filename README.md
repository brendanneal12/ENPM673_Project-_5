# Project Information

Goal: Computer Vision Algorithm to estimate a ship's draft marker reading.

File Name: integrated_final.py

Recommended IDE: Visual Studio Code

Python Version: 3

# Libraries Used:

numpy, opencv, pytesseract, re, from matplotlib: pyplot

# GitHub Repository Link:

https://github.com/brendanneal12/ENPM673_Project-_5

# Before Running Code:

Make sure to change the location of pytesseract download in line 8 of integrated_final.py.

# How to Run Code:
1. Download integrated_final.py and hull.mp4 to workspace.
2. Hit "Run"
3. The original video is outputted with the draft marker reading displayed in the video frame.
4. Additionally, the read height is printed to the terminal.
5. Once the video ends, a plot of all the read draft marker heights is displayed to the screen.
6. The average draft height for the entire video is printed to the terminal.
7. Close the plot to end the program.

# Important Notes:
1. Since large videos cannot be uploaded directly to GitHub, please follow the following link to view the outputted video: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11qIydcLes_15Ba3fLCreDEAaEvQHbtQR?usp=sharing
